## OpenRC-Turbo

OpenRC is a modified version of the official [FTC SDK](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone)
in which all of the source code that is normally tucked away inside the AAR files has been extracted into modules. This makes it easy to see and modify almost the entirety of the Robot Controller app's source code. In addition, the history in Git shows all changes that have been made to the core code since OpenRC's inception. This complements the changelogs that FIRST provides, allowing teams to see exactly what code has been changed.


## Legality for competition use

According to the [2021-2022 Game Manual Part 1](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/game-manual-part-1-traditional-events.pdf), teams are not allowed to replace or modify the portions of the SDK which are distributed as AAR files, per `<RS08>`. This means that in its default configuration, OpenRC is **not** legal for competition.

**HOWEVER**, in order to address this, OpenRC has a `stock` build variant which will compile the `TeamCode` and `FtcRobotController` modules against the official, unmodified AAR files, rather than against the extracted modules.

## Device Compatibility

Compatible with all legal FTC Robot Controller devices for the 2021-2022 season, including the Control Hub.

## Build variants

### Variant Descriptions

 - **Stock - 52.1MB APK** *(1.2x smaller)*
     - Competition legal
     - 64-bit libs removed

 - **Turbo - 11.6MB APK** *(5.4x smaller)*

     *Note: If you would like to use Blocks, you will need to copy your private Vuforia key into the `Blocks/src/main/assets/CzechWolf` file*
     - Vuforia native library loaded dynamically
     - Vuforia/TF datasets loaded dynamically
     - OnBotJava removed

 - **Extreme Turbo - 7.1MB APK** *(8.9x smaller)*
     - Vuforia native library loaded dynamically
     - Vuforia/TF datasets loaded dynamically
     - OnBotJava removed
     - Blocks removed
     - Sound files removed

## Setup Process

 1. Fork this repository
 2. Clone your fork
 3. Do `git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenRC-Turbo.git`
 4. Copy all of the files found in the `filesForDynamicLoad` folder of this repo into the `FIRST/vision` folder on the RC's internal storage
 5. Also copy the Freight Frenzy game assets from [the AAR](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/firstinspires/ftc/gameAssets-FreightFrenzy/1.0.0/gameAssets-FreightFrenzy-1.0.0.aar) into that same folder (you can also find them attached on the 7.0 release tag)
 6. Select your desired build variant (see the *Switching Build Variants* section)

## Update Process

Assuming you followed the above setup process, all that you need to do to update your fork when a new OpenRC release is available is:

 1. `git pull upstream master`
 2. Perform a Gradle Sync
 3. If the project fails to build, try *Clean Project*, *Rebuild Project*, and *Invalidate Caches / Restart*

## Switching Build Variants

**IMPORTANT: make sure to test that your project compiles correctly with the stock variant at least a week before your competition!**

Note: you may get a "variant conflict" when switching variants. You can fix this by changing the conflicting module's variant to match the variant you want.

 1. Open the Build Variants tab in the lower left hand corner of Android Studio
 2. In the dropdown for the **TeamCode module**, select your desired variant
 3. Perform a Gradle sync

## Versioning Scheme

To prevent confusion, OpenRC does not have its own version number. The version number will directly reflect the SDK version that the release is based on. However, the version number will have a letter appended to the end of it, which will be incremented (A-Z) for each release of OpenRC which is based on the same SDK version. When OpenRC is updated to be based on a new SDK version, the letter will reset to A.

For instance, the 3rd release of OpenRC based on SDK v5.0 would be `5.0C`, whereas the first release of OpenRC based on SDK v5.1 would be `5.1A`.

## Dynamic Loading of TensorFlow and Vuforia Datasets

In order to reduce APK size, the Turbo and Extreme Turbo variants do not bundle the Vuforia and TensorFlow datasets in the APK. However, once copied onto the internal storage (see step #4 in the *Setup Process* section), you can still use them in your OpMode by making a very minor change.

**NOTE:** The samples in this repo have already been adjusted with this change.

```java
/*
 * For Vuforia
 */
// Find a line similar to this in the program
vuforia.loadTrackablesFromAsset("DatasetName");
// And replace it with this (obviously adjusting the DatasetName)
vuforia.loadTrackablesFromFile("/sdcard/FIRST/vision/DatasetName");

/*
 * For TensorFlow
 */
// Find a line similar to this in the program
tfod.loadModelFromAsset("DatasetName.tflite");
// And replace it with this (obviously adjusting the DatasetName)
tfod.loadModelFromFile("/sdcard/FIRST/vision/DatasetName.tflite");

```
